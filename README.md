# Full Stack Web Dev Tools

Full Stack web dev Stack!
The ultimate full stack web dev I start to learn and use; you do not need much experience to use this stack!

First, if you do not have experience with npm and HTML CSS, you might want to get help from an AI such as ChatGPT or, better yet, GitHub Copilot. 

## Set-Up:

Install npm if you have not already.

[Node.js — Download Node.js® (nodejs.org)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

You can find tutorials somewhere else.

## The Stack

- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind
- Daisyui
- Versoly(Never tried )

### React:

You do not have to learn to react; it is just there for now.

### Next.js

You do not have to learn this too! The only thing you need to create a Next.js app is just:

```jsx
npx create-next-app your-project-name
```

### Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI

Well, this is just CSS and other style-related things. Tailwind is the base, and DaisyUI is a component Lib

## Conclusion:

Since this is a beginner stack, I am not going to talk about the back end; you should try [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

You can use MongoDB and Node.js for the backend.
